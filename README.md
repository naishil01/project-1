project (Data Analysis: Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction)
This project aims to predict whether patients will miss their healthcare appointments using machine learning models. It also provides data-driven insights through interactive Power BI dashboards to optimize appointment scheduling and reduce no-show rates.
### üìê **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
   - Imported raw data from CSV.
   - Cleaned missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering (e.g., appointment weekday, waiting days).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends like age distribution, SMS reminders, and weekday impact.
   - Identified key features affecting no-shows.

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained and tested a Decision Tree Classifier.
   - Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy score.
   - Hyperparameter tuning for better predictions.

4. **Dashboard Design (Power BI)**
   - Created interactive dashboards for real-time insights.
   - Integrated model predictions for deeper analysis.

5. **Optimization Recommendations**
   - Suggestions to improve scheduling efficiency and reduce no-shows.
